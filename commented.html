                <!--<p>I chose to make this career change because
                            <li> a) I was tired of living below my potential: I am a intelligent person with a creative soul,
                                and the internet is the world's newest and most vast canvas.</li>
                            <li> b) I want to be a part of the change: I've read the articles, seen the statistics, and heard
                                the stories. Tech is here, and to not be a part of it in some way will be detrimental to
                                my future. </li>
                            <li> c) After years of being a consumer of gadgets and lover of the web, it feels good to now be in
                                the driver seat. </li>
                        </p>-->
